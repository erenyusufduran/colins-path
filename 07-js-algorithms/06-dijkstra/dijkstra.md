# Dijkstra's Algorithm

Finds the shortest path between two vertices on a graph.

- *What's the fastest way to get from point A to point B?*

> Edsger Dijkstra was a Dutch programmer, physicist, essayist. He helped to advance the field of *computer science* from an **art** to an academic discipline.

> What is the shortest way to travel from *Rotterdam to Groningen*, in general: from given city to given city. *It is the algorithm for the shortest path*, which I designed in about twenty minutes. One morning I was shopping in *Amsterdam* with my youngest fiancee, and tired, we sat down on the cafe to drink a cup of coffee and I was just thinking about whether I could do this, and I then designed the algorithm for the shortest path. As I said, it was a twenty-minute invention. Eventually that algorithm became, to my great amazement, one of the cornerstones of my fame. - **Edsger Dijkstra**

### Why is it Useful?
- GPS - finding fast route
- Network Routing - finds open shortest path for data
- Biology - used to model the spread of viruses among humans
- Airline Tickets - finding cheapest route to your destination
- Many others..
