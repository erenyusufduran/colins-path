# Algorithms    
- An **algorithm** is a step-by-step procedure for performing some task in a finite amount of time.
- Typically, an algorithm takes input data and produces an output based upon it.
- A **data structure** is a systematic way of organizing and accessing data.

## Program Running Time
- Write a porgram implementing the algorithm
- Run the program with inputs of varying size and composition, nothing the time needed.

## What is an Algorithm?
- Mathematical abstraction
- Computational procedure to solve a program
