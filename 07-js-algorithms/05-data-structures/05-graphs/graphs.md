# GRAPHS

A **graph data structure** consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices or nodes or points, together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected **graph** or a set of ordered pairs for directed **graph**.

- Nodes + Connections

### Uses for Graphs
- Social Networks
- Location / Mapping
- Routing Algorithms
- Visual Hierarchy
- File System Optimizations
- **EVERYWHERE!**
