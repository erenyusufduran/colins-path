# Queues

A **FIFO** data structure.

> ### **FIRST IN FIRST OUT**

Queues exist everywhere! Think about the last time you waited in line...

## **How do we use them in programming?**
- Background Tasks
- Uploading Resources
- Printing / Task Processing

>  ### There is more than one way of implementing a Queue.
- **Array Implementation**
    - Use push and shift methods
    - Use unshift and pop methods
- **Linked List Implementation**



**Big O of Stacks**
- Insertion - **O(1)**
- Removal - **O(1)**
- Searching - **O(n)**
- Access - **O(n)**

## Recap
- Queues are **FIFO** data structure, all elements are first in first out.
- Queues are useful for processing tasks and are foundational for more complex data structures.
- Insertion and Removal can be done in O(1)
