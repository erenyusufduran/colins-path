# Data Structures
Data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data. 

Different data structures excel at different things. Some are highly specialized, while others (like arrays) are more generally used.

- The more time you spend as a developer, the more likely you'll need to use one of these data structures.
- You've already worked with many of them unknowingly.
- INTERVIEWS

### There is NO **BEST** DATA STRUCTURE, They all excel in different solutions.

- Working with map/location data? - **Use a graph!**
- Need an ordered list with fast inserts/removals at the beginning and end? - **Use a Linked Lists**
- Web scraping nested HTML? - **Use a Tree!**
- Need to write a scheduler? - **Use a Binary Heap!** 

We're going to implement **data structures** as **classes!**. So let's look at JS Classes.

## ES2015 Class Syntax
**Class** is a blueprint for creating objects with pre-defined properties and methods.
