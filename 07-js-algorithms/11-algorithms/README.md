## Introduction To Algorithms

- **FIRST DESIGN, THEN WRITE THE PROGRAM**

    |               Algorithm                |                  Program                  |
    | :------------------------------------: | :---------------------------------------: |
    |                 Design                 |              Implementation               |
    |            Domain knowledge            |                Programmer                 |
    | Any Language (English, Math Notations) | Programming Language (C, C++, Javascript) |
    |     Independent from Hardware & OS     |       Dependent from Hardware & OS        |
    |                Analyze                 |                  Testing                  |


First you know designing, make your design perfect and throught so that you can understand what you are going to construct, what you are going to develop then you start the **development**. You can not develop anything, you can not construct anything on trial and error basis. **How your program works?**

## Characteristics of Algorithm

1. **Input**: Some algorithm may not take any input also, but algorithm can take *0 or more* input.
2. **Output**: Algotihm must generate at least one output. Otherwise it's no use of writing a quarter it. It must generate some result. If it doesn't return anything, we say void; but it does something definitely.
3. **Definiteness**: Every statement should be an ambitious and it should have a single an exact meaning. You can not write any statement which can not be understood or which can not be solved. *If the human can not solve it we **can't ask our computers to solve***.
4. **Finiteness**: Algorithm is just like a function. A function will have some limited set of strips and it will stop and returns the result. *It must have finite set of statements*.
5. **Effectiveness**: You should not write **unneccessary statements** in an algorithm whatever the statement you write the objective is that should do something. So some purpose in the procedure in the steps of an algorithm.
