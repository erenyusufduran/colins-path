# SCRUM

Lightweight framework designed to solve complex problems that required sprinting or iterating through a solution.

So Scrum says you pick up a problem, you start working on it, and as you work on it you can look back and inspect it and adapt according to what you learn from the process of workşing itself.

## SPRINT

Sprint is just a time selected by the team, anywhere between 1-4 weeks, where they plan the work, they get the work ready, they develop and test and get it production ready so you can put that software in the hands of your customer by the end of the iteration, or the sprint.

- Scrum recommends a self-organizing and cross-functional team.

- If there is a challenge or conflict in the team, they come together and discuss and decide on a own way to move formard as a team.
