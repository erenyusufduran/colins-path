# Estimating

**Roughly Calculating** how long it's going to take us to complete a particular user story.

### Used To Estimate
- Elicted Information
    - This is what put together the core of that particular user story.
- Past Experiences
    - Past user story to actually help you create your best estimate for this user story.
- Documentation
    

## Estimating in Agile

### For Non-Agile

- Absolute estimate
    - Complete the requirements and you have handed that requirements.
- Measured in days
- Updates usually cause major impacts

### Agile

- Relative estimate
    - Relative to the other items that have already been estimated as part of that project.
- Placed into a bucket
- Updates usually cause minor impacts

## Why Estimating?

1. Provides estimated duration
2. Drives out clarification questions
3. Highlights complex and high risk rasks

## Estimation Techniques

- Big/Uncertain/Small (BUS)
    - Categorized into groupings
        - Big, Uncertain, Small
    - Each user story is compared to others and assigned to a group
        - 'Big' stories should be broken up if possible
        - 'Uncertain' stories need to be groomed or broken up
- T-Shirt Sizes
    - Categorized into typical t-shirt size
        - XS, S, M, L, XL
        - Larger stories should be broken up if possible.
- Fibonacci Sequence
    - Abstract value to represent size
        - 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...
    - Each user story is compared to others and assigned "Story Points"
        - Larger stories should be broken up if possible
    - Number of points per sprint is the team's velocity
