# Why Docker?

The reason that containers exist is three major reasons:

1. better isolation in a single OS
   - saving us time and OS and dependency management
   - also giving us the isolation we need to protect our application.
2. reduced environment variances
   - so the difference between each environment that it runs is very minimal. Usually just you connection settings for databases, maybe some URL paths, stuff like that, ports.
   - then the rest is all exactly the same as you built and tested it.
3. increasing our speed of change
   - not just for the software itself, but for the business that wants to implement that software.
