## Integration Issues

### Cons

- Type definition files alone can't express what is going on in the JS world accurately.
- Type definition files provided to us aren't always accurate.
- Inputs to a server (or any program with external inputs) are not guaranteed to exist, or be of the correct type.

### Pros

- Addressing these type issues with Typescript can force us to write better code.

  - Get better type safety (help TS do a better job of catching errors)
  - Significantly enhance the developer experience
