# Are Blockchain-based QR codes safe?

Assigning hash value to QR code: When a QR code is generated, the Blockchain system puts a unique hash value into the QR code. When the user or consumer scans the QR code to access the information or data, the system first cross-checks the hash value in the QR code. It then compares the hash value of the QR code to the hash value in the Blockchain. If it matches, only then can the user access the URL link. The fact is because of the immutability feature of Blockchain; once there is a hash value in the QR codes, nobody can modify or alter it. Also, two QR codes or any two transactions can never have the same hash value; each transaction on the Blockchain has a unique hash value.

# Why Is Blockchain QR Codes Safer Than Normal QR Codes?

QR code technology has no type of security flaws, and one cannot hack it. The security risks that people often associate with QR codes are like hacking, phishing or malware do not origin from QR code technology instead from the final destination of each code. of course, third parties might hack the web page, link up malicious software, or steal data, it is in the same way attackers conduct email or text message scams.

But, if you make the most of **blockchain benefit** through a blockchain-based QR code, you can be on the safer side. In a general QR code, there remains a risk that the data or the information in the QR codes can get manipulated. But it is not the case with the secure type of QR codes.

### **Summary**

General QR codes are safe, but since one can modify them, their safety stands vulnerable. However, if you use blockchain-based QR codes, they are future-proofed. Whether you use them for **secure documents** or data, nobody can modify them as the unique hash value in these QR codes is permanent.
