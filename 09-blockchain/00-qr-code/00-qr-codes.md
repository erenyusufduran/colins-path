# What is QR Code?

Every QR code is unique and works similarly to that of a barcode, but unlike a barcode reader that is required to read information embedded in barcodes, QR Codes do not require special devices. When a QR code reader application is installed, a consumer can simply point a smartphone’s camera at the code to scan and decode the message contained in it.

## Benefits of QR codes

The data stored in a QR code can be up to 3Kb, which may include website URLs, phone numbers, videos, geolocation, etc. Thus, QR codes can be used to:

1. Link directly to websites and product pages.
2. Send and receive payment
3. Track information about products in a supply chain

## Risk Of Using QR Codes

While QR codes offer a great way to store and access information, they come with a fair amount of risk. Inherently QR codes can’t be hacked. The security risks associated with QR codes like malware attacks, phishing, or hacking do not originate from QR code technology but instead from the final destination of each code.

After an enhancement in use and range of application for decades, QR codes enjoy a moment. In the year 2020, both consumers and businesses incorporated touchless solutions. Charities, App-centric payment companies, nonprofits, and point-of-sale systems used online QR code generators to make customer portals that dodged button pushing and credit card exchanges.

The giant tech companies are also embracing blockchain-based QR codes in a big way. Silicon Valley and other companies are finding QR codes effective for self-service information in transactions, retail stores, and other uses. Most interestingly, QR codes are becoming useful for augmented reality.

For example, marketers love QR codes because these are a convenient way to optimize campaigns. Instead of having customers visit a web address manually, QR codes remove potential typos by sending users directly to the company’s website, signup form, documents, or even app. Similarly, education institutions have started using QR codes to ensure that the concerned people or receivers can identify if the certificate or degree is fake or not. Once scanning the QR Code printed on the certificate, the end-user gets redirected to the website URL. Hence, QR codes include all the data and credentials of the certificate holder and keeps it safe. But the point is how secure are these QR codes.
