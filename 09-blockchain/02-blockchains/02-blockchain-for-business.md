# What is Blockchain for Business?
Blockchain for business is valuable for entities transacting with one another. With distributed ledger technology, permissioned participants can access the same information at the same time to improve efficiency, build trust and remove friction. Blockchain also allows a solution to rapidly size and scale, and many solutions can be adapted to perform multiple tasks across industries. Blockchain for business delivers these benefits based on four attributes unique to the technology:
- **Consensus**: Shared ledgers are updated only after the transaction is validated by all relevant participants involved.
- **Replication**: Once a block — the record of an event — is approved, it is automatically created across the ledgers for all participants in that channel. Every network partner sees and shares a single “trusted reality” of the transactions.
- **Immutability**: More blocks can be added, but not removed, so there is a permanent record of every transaction, which increases trust among the stakeholders.
- **Security**: Only authorized entities are allowed to create blocks and access them. Only trusted partners are given access permission.

## Applications of Blockchain for Business

- **Blockchain ensures safer food**
    - We all eat – and we’ve all had second thoughts about food safety or freshness. What if we could replace those doubts with visibility into every step from farm to fork? Many companies are now doing just that, sharing and using data from IBM Food Trust™, built on the IBM Blockchain Platform.
    - Discover how growers, processors, distributors, and retailers are making food safer, lengthening shelf lives, reducing waste, and unlocking better access to shared, secure information that impacts us all.

- **Blockchain tracks every step in shipping**
    - Think of everything you’ve used today. How did it get here? Today’s supply chain is a complex network of relationships, scheduling, systems and data. Even the smallest error can lead to delays that have tremendous ripple effects.
    - By digitizing and automating paperwork across supply chains, IBM Blockchain helps shippers, ports, customs services, logistics providers, banks, insurers, and others better manage documents across organizations and borders – all in real time and with absolute precision.
