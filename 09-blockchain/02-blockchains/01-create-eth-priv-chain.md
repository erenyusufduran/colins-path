# What is Ethereum Private Network
Ethereum private network is a private blockchain completely isolated from the main Ethereum network. Typically, private networks are created by organizations to store personal data that should not be visible to people outside the organization. In addition, the private network Ethereum can be used for testing and experiments with the blockchain.

**Features of private Ethereum blockchain:**

- The private network blockchain is not affiliated with the main Ethereum chain.
- Access to the network is limited to one or more nodes.
- Creating private Ethereum networks for free.
- The complexity of mining is set during the creation.
- Free transactions.

## What is Ethereum Virtual Machine? 
Ethereum is a network of many nodes, or EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine). EVM is software that can understand a set of instructions written according to certain rules (to start a transaction, smart contracts, applications) and execute them on the Ethereum network in a certain logical order, like a normal computer.

To start a private blockchain, your computer must become a node in the Ethereum network, that is, you need to download the entire blockchain network and synchronize it with the main chain of **Ethereum**. 

1. **Geth (Go Ethereum):** The implementation of the Go (Golang) programming language for Ethereum is called Geth. This is one of the three initial implementations of the Ethereum protocol (along with Python and C++). Choose this tool if you have at least minimal web development experience and want to experiment or create professional interfaces for dapps.
2. **Pyethapp:** A Python-based client that implements the “Ethereum cryptoeconomic finite state machine”. You need to choose if you are interested in developing dapps or academic studies of the Ethereum network.
3. **C++ (Eth):** Ethereum implementation in C++. Choose if you are serious about mining on the GPU or need to increase security by running two program implementations.

Using these tools, you can access the console (terminal) - a JavaScript environment containing all the basic functions that we will need later. Access to the console is the main thing you need to start the private Ethereum blockchain, so ultimately it’s not particularly important which tool you choose.

## What is Geth (Go Ethereum)
Geth is a command line interface tool (CLI) that connects your system and equipment to the Ethereum network. With geth you can:
- carry out financial transactions;
- mine ether (utilitarian currency of the Ethereum network);
- create smart contracts, decentralized applications;
- create private blockchains;
- explore the block history;
- much more

The rest goes into too much technique...
