# Public, Private, Permissioned Blockchains

Public blockchains allow anyone to access them; private blockchains are closed to only selected users; permissioned blockchains are a hybrid of public and private blockchains where anyone can access them as long as they have permission from the administrators to do so.

**KEY TAKEAWAYS**
- In a public blockchain, anyone is free to join and participate in the core activities of the blockchain network.
- A private blockchain allows only selected and verified participants; the operator has the rights to override, edit, or delete entries on the blockchain.
- A permissioned blockchain has properties of both private and public blockchains.
- Permissioned blockchains have seen an increase in popularity thanks to their ability to allocate specific permissions to various users on the network.

## **Public Blockchains**
A public blockchain is one where anyone is free to join and participate in the core activities of the blockchain network. Anyone can read, write, and audit the ongoing activities on a public blockchain network, which helps achieve the self-governed, decentralized nature often touted when blockchain is discussed.
### **Advantages**
A public network operates on an incentivizing scheme that encourages new participants to join and keep the network agile. Public blockchains offer a particularly valuable solution from the point of view of a truly decentralized, democratized, and authority-free operation.
### **Disadvantages**
The primary disadvantage to secured public blockchains is the heavy energy consumption required to maintain them. The concern is a consensus mechanism that requires participants to compete to validate the information and receive a reward for letting the network use their processing power. Not all blockchain networks use an energy-intensive validation process, so not all use enormous amounts of electricity.

Other issues include the lack of complete privacy and anonymity. Public blockchains allow anyone to view transaction amounts and the addresses involved. If the address owners become known, the user loses their anonymity.

Public blockchains also attract participants who may not be honest in their intentions. Most public blockchains are designed for cryptocurrencies, which by nature of their value are a prime target for hackers and thieves.

## **Private Blockchains**
Participants can join a private blockchain network only through an invitation where their identity or other required information is authentic and verified. The validation is done by the network operator(s) or by a clearly defined set protocol implemented by the network through smart contracts or other automated approval methods.
### **Advantages**
A private blockchain is not decentralized. It is a distributed ledger that operates as a closed database secured with cryptographic concepts and the organization's needs. Only those with permission can run a full node, make transactions, or validate/authenticate the blockchain changes.

By reducing the focus on protecting user identities and promoting transparency, private blockchains prioritize efficiency and immutability—the state of not being able to be changed.

These are important features in supply, logistics, payroll, finances, accounting, and many other enterprise and business areas.
### **Disadvantages**
While purposefully designed for enterprise applications, private blockchains lose out on many of the valuable attributes of permissionless systems simply because they are not widely applicable. They are instead built to accomplish specific tasks and functions.

In this respect, private blockchains are susceptible to data breaches and other security threats. This is because there is generally a limited number of validators used to reach a consensus about transactions and data if there is a consensus mechanism.

## **Permissioned  Blockchains**
Permissioned blockchains are a mix between the public and private blockchains and support many options for customization.
### **Advantages**
Permissioned blockchain advantages include allowing anyone to join the permissioned network after a suitable identity verification process. Some give special and designated permissions to perform only specific activities on a network. This allows participants to perform particular functions such as reading, accessing, or entering information on the blockchain.

Permissioned blockchains allow for many functions, but one most interesting to businesses is Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS)—a blockchain designed to be scalable for the needs of many companies or tasks that the providers rent out to other businesses.
### **Disadvantages**
The disadvantages of permissioned blockchains mirror those of public and private blockchains, depending on how they are configured. One key disadvantage is that because permissioned blockchains require internet connections, they are vulnerable to hacking. By design, some might use immutability techniques such as cryptographic security measures and validation through consensus mechanisms.
