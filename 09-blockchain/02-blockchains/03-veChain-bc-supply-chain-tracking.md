# VeChain: Blockchain Supply Chain Tracking

VeChain (VET) is a **blockchain platform that seeks to enhance supply chain management processes with specialized functions.** It uses tamper-proof distributed ledger technology to determine the authenticity and quality of products purchased by platform users.

VeChain sees blockchain technology as an infrastructure through which **business and industry can transfer and store data in a decentralized manner**. Starting with logistics, other economic sectors should also be able to benefit from VeChain in real use cases.
A special feature is the Proof of Authority consensus mechanism, which has caused quite some buzz.

## The Mission

**The VeChain Coin solves a problem that is very common in todayâ€™s era of globalization**. More and more parcels are being sent and thus more and larger supply chains must be able to be traced. With the previous technology, companies have often reached their limits. This is exactly where VeChain comes in. The decentralized nature of distributed ledger technology ensures that the supply chain is completely transparent for all parties involved and that the supply chain remains unchanged. **The primary goals are:**
1. To build a **distributed ecosystem based on blockchain technology for transparent information flow**, high-speed value transfer, and efficient collaboration.
2. End users, retailers, and producers should be able to have a **reliable source of truth** without having to blindly trust each other.
3. It aims to achieve secure supply chain management solutions through asset digitization.

In summary, Vechain aims to be the leading platform to deliver real economic and social value blockchain-based.
