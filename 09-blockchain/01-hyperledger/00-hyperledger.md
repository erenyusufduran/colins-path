# HYPERLEDGER

Hyperledger technologies are transforming a wide range of existing markets and driving a growing list of new business models in emerging markets. According to research from Blockdata, Hyperledger technologies are used by more of the top 100 public companies in the world than any other blockchain platform.

## What Hyperledger Does

The first application of blockchain was Bitcoin, which used the decentralized architecture and immutable records of the technology to introduce cryptocurrencies to the world. Blockchain technology and digital currencies - have been linked together in the public imagination ever since.

But there is a difference. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum enable transactions on large-scale, public networks with permissionless models. There are no limits on who can buy, sell, trade, and transact over the network. Anyone can see the whole history of what has transpired as it is written, block by block. Users operate freely and quite often anonymously.

The Hyperledger Foundation is focused on consortium networks that link a group of stakeholders to streamline critical, often proprietary business processes and transactions. There is no one Hyperledger blockchain network. Instead, businesses, consortia, and other organizations deploy Hyperledger technologies to build networks that support their needs. 

With this approach, these networks, or multiparty systems, are modular and flexible enough to support different industries and use cases. The diverse and growing Hyperledger ecosystem means enterprises can mix and match technologies to balance privacy and performance; create permissioned, permissionless, or hybrid networks; integrate with legacy systems; or even tap into a cryptocurrency **mainnet.**

The Hyperledger Foundation does not sell any of these technologies as products or services. Hyperledger projects are vendor neutral, meaning that they can be deployed in products and solutions by any company, anywhere in the world. 

As a result, Hyperledger technologies are used in everything from powering global trade networks and supply chains to fighting counterfeit drugs, banking “unbanked” populations, and ensuring sustainable manufacturing. 

Hyperledger-based networks are used by some of the largest corporations around the world, including more than half of the companies on the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2021/02/02/blockchain-50/?sh=19f7f656231c">Forbes Blockchain 50</a>, a list of companies with revenue or a valuation of at least $1 billion that lead in employing distributed ledger technology.

## Hyperledger Technologies

The Hyperledger Foundation hosts a wide array of community-led, open source projects that are all freely available under the Apache 2.0 license. These projects fall into a number of categories, including:

- **Distributed Ledgers** - A distributed ledger is a multiparty database with no central trusted authority. When transactions are processed in blocks according to the ordering of a blockchain, the result is a distributed ledger. Hyperledger hosts a variety of <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/distributed-ledgers">distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) </a> or platforms that serve as the foundation for blockchain networks across a range of industries and use cases. 

- **Libraries** - <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/libraries">Hyperledger libraries</a> are tested and proven code bases that can be deployed easily to address core requirements or add key functionality for a variety of enterprise blockchain use cases. Hyperledger libraries include toolkits for digital credentials, smart contracts, and cryptographic code

- **Tools** - <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/tools">Hyperledger tools</a> improve the implementation of enterprise blockchains. They
give those deploying Hyperledger—and, in some cases, other DLTs—an edge when
tackling complex challenges such as interoperability, performance, and security. 

- **Labs** - Dozens of other technologies are being nurtured in the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/">Hyperledger Labs</a>. While a full project goes through a formal review and acceptance process with the Technical Steering Committee (TSC), a code base can become a Hyperledger Lab through a simple request to one of the lab stewards. The aim of Hyperledger Labs is to encourage more developers to get involved in the community and to experiment with the technologies. 

The mix of Hyperledger projects reflects the different approaches and challenges to building enterprise blockchains and the priorities of those looking to build or reshape different markets with the technology. Because they are community developed, Hyperledger projects create a <a href="https://landscape.hyperledger.org/">landscape</a> of technologies that are open, trusted, and at work in a fast-growing list of production blockchain networks.
