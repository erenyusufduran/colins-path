# Multi Org Setup with Root Certification Authority

Beginning of this initiative, it was decided that the network will be setup with the Orderer Organization and Acme Organization and then in phase two, we add the Budget Organization.

We have tried the network setup with the best crypto material generated by cryptogen tool. Going forward, we're going to add the CA server in this mix. So the identities for all the components in the network will be managed in the CA server.

- In test setup, there is `ca/multi-org-ca` in this folder there is a subfolders like `client` and `server`.
- `orderer/mult-org-ca`
- `peer/multi-org-ca`
