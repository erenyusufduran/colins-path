# Chaincode Lifecycle

There are four stages in the setup of a chaincode in fabric 2.x

1. Chaincode Development
   - Spesifications
   - Coding
   - Package
2. Installation
   - Orgs _install_ the chaincode
3. Approval
   - Organizations _approve_ the Chaincode parameters
4. Committing
   - One of the **Org Admin** commits

## Chaincode Development & Installation

Smart contact is the specifications of the transactions defined on a blockchain network. These spesifications includes;

- Transaction Interfaces
- Busines Rules
- Workflow Logic

- Chaincode **implements** Smart Contract. **Actually implements one or more**.

### Development Flow

Once the smart contract have been agreed upon, developer from one organization can pick up the specification and implement the chaincode.

After implementing the chaincode they can package it and put it in a shared repository. Organizations that have decided to use the shared code can access this repository, so admins from org sharing the court will pick up the package from the repository and install it on the peers in their respective organizations.

Let's say there is an organization that would like to create their own chaincode implementation from these specifications. Developer from that organization can then implement the specification on their own and clear it on specific chaincode implementation.

### Chaincode Package

- Chaincode **code** along with _metadata_.

  ```
  tar.gz
    |
    |__ `code.tar.gz` - Tar file with source code
    |
    |__ `metadata.json` - Metadata JSON file.
  ```

Package Identitiy = LABEL

- Package requires a _Label_
- Organization may decide on a scheme for the _Label_
- Label is saved in the **metadata**

### Package Installation on Peers

- Chaincode installed by the Org admins
- Generates the **Package-ID;** needed for approval
- Package-ID Format
  - `Label: Long String`
- Chaincode Package-ID MUST be consistent within Org
- Each org approves the specific package for their Org
- Package-ID may be different across Orgs
- Not all Orgs need to install
  - Orgs participating in the transactions
  - Orgs that will query the ledgers
  - Chaincode Endorsers MUST install

Admin can use package Id for approval.

To manage the lifecycle on tha chaincode in fabric 2.x;

- `peer lifecycle chaincode cmd --flag`
  - `package` - Packages the chaincode `tar-file-path --flags`
    - `p` - Path to chaincode
    - `--label` - Label assigned by admin
    - `-l` - Language, default=golang
    - Package Label Convention
      - Chaincode_Name . ChainCode_Version - Org_specific_version
    - Package Tar file Naming
      - Label.tar.gz - `--label gocc.1.0-1.0`
    1. Setup the environment
       - `. ./env.sh`
       - `mkdir -p $HOME/packages`
       - `CC_LABEL=gocc.1.0-1.0`
       - `CC_PACKAGE_FILE=$HOME/$CC_LABEL.tar.gz`
    2. Create the package
       - `peer lifecycle chaincode package $CC_PACKAGE_FILE`
       - `--label $CC_LABEL`
       - `-p chaincode_example02`
  - `install` - Installs the chaincode to the specified peer
    - `peer lifecycle chaincode install tar-file-path`
    1. Launch the Peer
    2. Install the package to the Peer
    3. Inspect the **Peer filesystem & QueryInstalled**
    ```
    ls -la $CORE_PEER_FILESYSTEMPATH/lifecycle
    ```
  - `queryinstalled` - Lists the installed chaincode on the peer
    - `peer lifecycle chanicode queryinstalled`

## Chaincode Approve & Commit

There are two part of chaincode. The first part is the bytecode and the second part is the set of parameters.

### Bytecode

- Administrator of an organization identifies the packaged bytecode by label and the package is then approved by the administrator for use within the organization.
- This approved package is then installed on the peers within the organization. Approval may be carried out on _committed_ as well as _uncommitted_ CC.

### Parameters

There are six parameters;

- Name
- Version
- Sequence
- Initialization Requirements
- Private Data Collections
- Chaincode Endorsement Policy
- ESCC/VSCC Plugin

The objective behind approval process is to ensure that these parameters match accross these organizations.

> When an organization approves the chaincode, it leads to the creation of a transaction which is recorded in the channels ledger. A chaincode can only be invoked or queried if the current transaction is successful.

### Lifecycle Endorsement Policy (Signature Policy)

- Network members sets up the _Lifecycle Endorsement Policy_.
  - How many approvals are needed?
  - Any specific organization that will MUST endorse?
- Rules are embedded in the Channel **Genesis**.
- Rules may be updated with Channel update transactions

  ***

- Rule=`MAJORITY Endorsement`
  - More than HALF members MUST approve
- Rule=`ANY Endorsement`
  - Only one approval needed for committing the Chaincode
- Signature Policy for flexible expressions
- Initialization required parameter of he chaincode
  - If the _init_ is required or not.
  - Fabric Runtime enforces the requirement.
    - Chaincode CAN NOT be _Invoked/Queried_ unless it is initialized.
    - Committed chaincode can be initialized only _ONCE_.
  - Sequence Number parameter
    - Developer specifies it as part of approval.ÅŸ
    - Default sequence number = 1, So the first time a chaincode approved by any organizaton sequence number has to be 1.
    - Running number; incremented with successful commit.
  - Chaincode Endorsement Policy
    - Parameter - NOT the same as lifecycle endorsement policy
    - Expression that describes the Orgs that need to endorse
    - Example:
      - `OR(`BudgetMSP.member`)`
      - `AND(`BudgetMSP.member`, `AcmeMSP.member`)`
