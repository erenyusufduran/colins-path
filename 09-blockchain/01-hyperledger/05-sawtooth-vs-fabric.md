# Hyperledger Sawtooth Vs. Fabric: How Are They Different?

Hyperledger blockchain is one of the popular projects on the market right now. Hyperledger Fabric and Hyperledger Sawtooth are two platforms that offer the best of the best output for enterprises. That’s why there’s always a popular debate on Hyperledger Sawtooth vs Fabric.

Many of you also think that both of the platforms are more or less the same. But that’s not the real case. In reality, there are some distinct differences between them, and today we’ll talk about them as well.

Hyperledger Fabric seems to be a bit more on the popular side, but both of the platforms have their special use cases. Anyhow, enough with the chit chat, let’s start the comparison of Hyperledger Sawtooth vs Fabric.

## What is Hyperledger Sawtooth?

First of all, we’ll start with a little introduction to both of the platforms to clear things up for you a bit. <a href="https://101blockchains.com/hyperledger-sawtooth/">Hyperledger Sawtooth</a> is one of the major open-source projects of the consortium Hyperledger. In reality, it does have some similarities with Hyperledger Fabric.

However, it’s more suited for developing decentralized applications or platforms.

Also, they ensure that you have the best smooth experience in the development. Therefore, they kept the development layer totally separated from the main network.

That’s why no matter what you do, the core system will always stay unaffected. More so, the increasing amount of resource sharing won’t affect the core system in any way. Thus, making this platform the perfect example of developing applications.

You should keep in mind that the platform does support a wide variety of programming languages. So, that gives you a whole lot of interesting ways to <a href="https://101blockchains.com/implement-blockchain/">implement blockchain</a> applications or blockchain solutions.

You can learn more about the use cases in the <a href="https://101blockchains.com/hyperledger-sawtooth-tutorial/">Hyperledger Sawtooth tutorial</a>. Actually, Hyperledger does offer very enriching tutorials on Sawtooth just to help developers understand it better. So, if you are interested in learning more about it, you can easily use their Hyperledger sawtooth use cases for that.

### Key Features of Hyperledger Sawtooth

- **Easy Application Development**
  If you check out any Hyperledger Sawtooth example, you’ll see that it’s quite easy to use the platform to develop applications. As you already know, the central core isn’t connected to the application layer. Therefore, it makes it really easy to develop blockchain solutions without affecting the real core itself.

  More so, there are lots of smart contract development options. Among them, you can choose a preferred programming language and work on that. In reality, you can also ensure that you have smart contract facilities on the platform.

  You can even make it only a smart contract application as well.

  ***

- **Private and Public Network**
  Another great feature of Sawtooth is that it offers 2 variants of blockchain for any kind of use case. It means that you will get both permissioned and permissionless access using this platform.

  In reality, this is something not many platforms can offer. More so, they can offer either permissioned or permissionless, but never both.

  <a href="https://101blockchains.com/companies-investing-in-blockchain/">Companies investing in blockchain</a> can use this feature to get more options and flexibility. So, if in one solution you need permissioned access, then you can go for that. On the other hand, you can also go for permissionless access as well. You can easily see it in any Hyperledger Sawtooth example.

  ***

- **Modular Structure**
  This is a bit similar to Fabric as both of them offer a modular structure for your enterprise needs. It’s also one of the greatest additions of Sawtooth architecture. In reality, if you study any Hyperledger Sawtooth example, you will see that it’s extremely easy to customize this platform.

  It’s definitely, on the whole, another level. Hyperledger doesn’t want to limit your innovation. Thus, it makes sure to include as much as blockchain features as it can for you to check out.

  In reality, if you want to add a completely foreign feature, you can simply just plug it in and use it.

  ***

- **Execution of Parallel Transaction**
  Another great feature of Sawtooth is that it comes with parallel transaction verification. Do you know what that means? In simple terms, it can verify multiple transactions in parallel to one another. So, it will take the same time to complete hundreds of transactions together.

  In reality, it gets rid of the massive work pressure from the network and saves a lot of time in the process. Thus, you will see your transaction processing much sooner compared to other platforms.

  ***

- **Sawtooth-Ethereum Integration Project (Seth)**
  This is actually very important as it lets you use the EVM in Hyperledger Sawtooth without any issues. Do you know that with this feature, you can actually develop a form of interoperability between Ethereum and Sawtooth?

  Yes, you can actually achieve a form of <a href="https://101blockchains.com/blockchain-interoperability/">blockchain interoperability</a> with it. How cool is that, right? Anyhow, you can learn more about using it more than their Hyperledger sawtooth use cases.

  ***

- **Pluggable Consensus Algorithms**
  In every Hyperledger Sawtooth example, the consensus algorithms are very important things you should notice. Why? Well, Sawtooth offers much more flexibility when it comes to consensus algorithms.

  More so, it actually comes with a pluggable blockchain protocol option that helps you choose any favorite consensus algorithm.

  Do you know what this means? It means that you won’t get stuck with working with a single consensus process. Therefore, if you think that a certain consensus will go better with your blockchain solution’s workload, you can go for it.

  In reality, you can even use multiple consensus algorithms to run multiple features of your solution. For example, you can use the “X” algorithm for smart contracts and the “Y” algorithm for transactions.

  ***

- **Transaction Family Models**
  When you study the Hyperledger Sawtooth example, you will see that the architecture offers some transaction families. In reality, the network actually operates using these families. Many Hyperledger sawtooth use cases use transaction families.

  Anyhow, Sawtooth is offering some options for you to get started. So, let’s check them out and see what they each are.

  - **BlockInfo Transaction Family:** In reality, you can use these to store information about blocks.
  - **Smallbank Transaction Family:** You can use Smallbank to test and analyze the performance of your solution.
  - **Settings Transaction Family:** This one will offer you reference models for storing on-chain configuration settings.
  - **Validator Registry Transaction Family:** More so, using the validator registry family, you can add more validators into the network.
  - **IntegerKey Transaction Family:** Want to test deployed ledgers? You can use IntegerKey to test them out.
  - **XO Transaction Family:** This is actually a bit on the fun side. In reality, you can use it to play tic-tac-toe with another node on the network.
  - **Identity Transaction Family:** It will preserve all the permissioning data for validators and even transacting nodes with their public key, thus giving you a digital identity.
  - **Seth Transaction Family:** This family is extremely necessary as it offers Ethereum Virtual Machine compatibility for the platform. So, using this, you can run smart contracts in Solidity.
  - **Sabre Transaction Family:** It’s also another family that will help you run smart contracts. But here, you can run it on a WebAssembly (WASM) virtual machine. In reality, it will help you run the contract on-chain.
