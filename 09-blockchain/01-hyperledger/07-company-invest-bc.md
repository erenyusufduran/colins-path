# Companies Investing in Blockchain

Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology. It offers the ability to communicate, transact, and store data without a centralized entity.

A blockchain network consists of peers. Each of the peers has a copy of the distributed ledger for public networks. For private networks, peers can be picked for participation and carrying the distributed ledgers.

There are some key features of blockchain that make it so amazing! These features include:

- Immutability
- Transparency
- Security
- Distributed Ledger
